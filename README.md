## Getting Started
Install OpenCV and other dependencies on Python:

```
pip install opencv-python==4.5.4.58 python-dotenv
```

Create a `.env` file with the same structure as `.envsample` before running the program. Change the values for your specific environment.

Now compile and run the test program:

```
python3 test.py
```
